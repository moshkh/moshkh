## What am I upto right now

:pencil2: Creating a personal portfolio website with SvelteKit on the front-end and Express.js + PSQL on the backend. The website will include a personal blog, the entries will be saved on the PSQL database. RESTful API's will be created to link the backend to the frontend.

:pencil2: A pet project which essentially is a tool to help with listing on the Etsy marketplace. It will interface with the Etsy API and improve the workflow for sellers to update / create new listings. My dad has an online business and he sells on different marketplaces including Etsy, I'm creating this tool with him in mind - addressing the challenges he faces when listing his products on Etsy. (In the planning stages for this project)
